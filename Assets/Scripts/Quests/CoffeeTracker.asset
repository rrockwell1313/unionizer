  - "<b>Smiling warmly</b>\r\n\r\n \"Oh, hello dear! You must be the new developer.
    I'm Amelie, I handle HR here. I just adore making sure everyone feels comfortable
    and valued. \r\n\r\nIs there something on your mind? Giacomo or the security
    team acting up again?\u201D\r\n"
  - "\"A union? Oh, my! That\u2019s such a daring move, But, if it\u2019s for the
    betterment of my dear coworkers, I\u2019m inclined to support it. However, I
    can\u2019t think straight without my <color=green>coffee</color> and someone
    seems to have <color=red>misplaced the coffee pot!</color> \u201C\r\n\r\n\u201CMy
    tummy\u2019s been acting up too, you see, and coffee calms it down. <i>It\u2019s
    a little embarrassing.</i>\"\r\n"
  - "\"I\u2019d love to sign your petition, but first, could you help me find the
    <color=green>coffee pot</color>? I heard that silly <color=red>security team
    was playing keep-away</color> with it earlier.\u201D\r\n \r\n\u201CI would be
    ever so grateful if you could retrieve it so I can make a fresh pot of coffee.
    My signature awaits!\"\r\n"
  irritatedDialogue:
  - "<b>*looking worried*</b>\r\n\r\n\u201COh dear, still no coffee pot? My insides
    are doing a little dance. <i>*Giggles nervously*</i> ,But I have faith in you!\u201D\r\n
    \r\n\u201CYou look like someone who can solve a <color=green>coffee pot mystery</color>.
    Please find it soon, my dear. A cup of joe and a signed petition are both brewing
    in spirit!\"\r\n"
  angryDialogue:
  - "<b>Gently swinging her legs but with a stern face</b>\r\n\r\n \"Oh dear, I had
    faith in you. I needed that coffee to keep my spirits high. But now, my cup is
    empty just like my patience.\u201D\r\n \r\n\u201CThere'll be <color=red>no signature
    for your petition from me.</color> I must kindly ask you to leave my office.
    My door is always open, but maybe not for you anymore.\"\r\n"
  successDialogue:
  - "<b>*Claps hands joyfully</b>\r\n\r\n \"Oh, thank heavens! The sacred coffee
    pot! You, my dear, are a life-saver.\u201D\r\n\r\n <b>*Begins brewing coffee*</b>\r\n\r\n
    \u201CAh, the aroma! Now, let me just take a sip... Perfect! As promised, here\u2019s
    <color=green>my signature for the union.</color>. You\u2019re doing a wonderful
    thing for all of us. Bless your heart!\r\n"
