    betterment of my dear coworkers, I\u2019m inclined to support it. However, I
    can\u2019t think straight without my coffee and someone seems to have misplaced
    the coffee pot! My tummy\u2019s been acting up too, you see, and coffee calms
    it down. It\u2019s a little embarrassing.\""

    coffee pot? I heard that silly security team was playing keep-away with it earlier.
    I would be ever so grateful if you could retrieve it so I can make a fresh pot
    of coffee. My signature awaits!\""

    I needed that coffee to keep my spirits high. But now, my cup is empty just like
    my patience. There'll be no signature for your petition from me. I must kindly
    ask you to leave my office. My door is always open, but maybe not for you anymore."
