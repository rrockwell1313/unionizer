    "Ah, il nuovo programmatore!
    Welcome, my friend. I am Giacomo, the maestro of data! They say numbers don''t
    lie, but let me tell you, neither does love. Ah, the beautiful Priscilla. She
    is like a fine wine."

    

    <b>Sighs dreamily</b>

    

    "What brings
    you to my abode of wisdom and romance?"'
  - '"Unionize, eh? That sounds like a rebellious venture. Giacomo loves a good rebellion!
    Ah, but <color=green>Priscilla</color>... Her smile could launch a thousand ships.
    I would be more inspired to join your cause if only my heart''s desire were fulfilled."'

    "Here''s my proposition: I have penned
    a love letter to the divine <color=green>Priscilla</color>, a letter that carries
    the weight of my heart. I signed it with a kiss! Deliver it to her, and make
    sure she knows it''s from her secret admirer, Giacomo. Then, my friend, I will
    sign your petition with the same passion I reserve for amore!"'
  irritatedDialogue:
  - '<b>Exclaims with hands on heart</b>

    

    "Mamma mia! You have not delivered
    my love letter to the enchanting <color=green>Priscilla</color>? My heart, it
    weeps! Please, I beg you, be my Cupid and deliver my affection to her! Giacomo
    will not rest until his love knows no bounds!"'

  - "<b>In a heavy Italian accent, visibly agitated</b>\r\n\r\n\"Madonna mia! You
    are toying with Giacomo\u2019s heart! First, you gave me hope, and now you keep
    breaking it! <color=green>Priscilla</color> deserves my letter of amore! Forget
    about Giacomo\u2019s <color=red>signature</color>! Since you don\u2019t respect
    the art of love, you must leave Giacomo\u2019s sanctuary! Arrivederci forever!\""

  - "<b>Clasps hands together</b>\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I can feel the shift in the wind!
    <color=green>Priscilla</color> must have received my letter! Grazie, my friend.
    As promised, Giacomo will sign your petition with the fervor of a thousand poets.\"\r\n\r\n<b>Signs
    dramatically</b>\r\n\r\n\"Viva la union! And viva l\u2019amore!\""
