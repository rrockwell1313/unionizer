  - "looks up from a stack of papers, frazzled \"Oh, hello. You're the new developer,
    aren\u2019t you? I\u2019ve heard about you. I\u2019m Priscilla. I'm sorry, but
    if you need something from me, you\u2019d better be quick. My to-do list is longer
    than War and Peace right now.\""
  - "\"Unionize? Honestly, I could use any break I can get. But I've got enough on
    my plate, and the boss watches my every move. I can\u2019t risk stirring the
    pot right now unless\u2026 well, unless I can offload something.\"ed something
    from me, you\u2019d better be quick. My to-do list is longer than War and Peace
    right now.\""
  - "\"Okay, here\u2019s the deal. There's this memo I have to deliver to Giacomo,
    the Data Analyst. He\u2019s...persistent. A little too much, if you catch my
    drift. I could use a break from his never-ending 'romantic' overtures. If you
    could take this memo to him and save me the trouble, I\u2019ll sign your petition.
    Fair?\""
  irritatedDialogue:
  - "Sighs heavily \"You still haven\u2019t given Giacomo the memo? Seriously? My
    sanity is hanging by a thread here. Look, I agreed to sign your thing, but only
    if you get that creep off my back for a day. Chop chop!\""
  angryDialogue:
  - "visibly stressed \"Seriously? This is the last straw! I cannot deal with Giacomo
    and now I cannot deal with you! You\u2019ve had more than enough time to deliver
    a simple memo! Forget about me signing any petition! Leave my desk area and don\u2019t
    you dare come back without an appointment, which I will NEVER give you!\""
  successDialogue:
  - "\"You did it? You actually handed Giacomo the memo? Oh, thank you! You've given
    me a moment\u2019s peace. signs the petition Here you go. And hey, if you're
    ever interested in a career as a professional barrier between creepy analysts
    and overworked secretaries, you've got a knack for it!\""
