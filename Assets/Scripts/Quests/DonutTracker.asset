    code for <color=green>donuts</color>! <i>giggles</i> Oh, don\u2019t mind me,
    I\u2019m just jonesing for something sweet. What\u2019s up?\""
  - "the break room! And maybe an endless supply of <color=green>cookies</color>?
    But wait, signing things makes me nervous. Can\u2019t focus... hmm. You help
    me, I help you? <b>Deal?</b>\""
  - '"<b>Nods eagerly</b>

    

    Okay! Fetch me a <color=green>dozen donuts</color>
    from the kitchen! But listen closely, I need at least <color=green>three with

    This is like a never-ending loop of disappointment! I need my sugar fix and you\u2019ve
    let me down one too many times! Don't even think about that petition! <color=red>My
