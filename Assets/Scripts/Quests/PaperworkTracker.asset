  - "Speaking energetically on the phone \"Absolutely, sir! That deal is a game changer!
    hangs up, becomes monotonous Oh, you\u2019re here with my pizza? No? Thai food?
    Oh, you work here. You're...maintenance? No, wait, IT something. What do you
    want?\""
  - "\"Unionize? Like, with tools and stuff? Oh, you mean like a... group thing.
    Gotcha. That sounds fine, I guess. But, uhh, if we do that, some of my, umm,
    paperwork might not look so good. I don't even like paperwork. It's like, words
    and numbers. Why can\u2019t they stay in their own lanes, you know?\""
  - "\"How about this, since you\u2019re good with, umm, computery things, can you
    get someone to take over my sales paperwork? Maybe that fidgety accountant lady?
    Dulcinea, yeah. If she could take this off my hands, I\u2019ll sign your... whatever
    it is.\""
  irritatedDialogue:
  - "\"You didn't find someone for my paperwork yet? Are you sure you\u2019re not
    the pizza delivery person? Oh well. If you\u2019re a paperwork wizard or something,
    just wave your magic wand and get Dulcinea to help me. Then I'll sign your, uhh,
    thing.\""
  angryDialogue:
  - "\"monotone, rolling his eyes Well, I guess the paperwork wizard lost his magic.
    Honestly, I had low expectations, but you managed to get under that bar. You
    can forget about my signature. Don't come back here without a pizza or Thai food,
    or better yet, don\u2019t come back at all.\""
  successDialogue:
  - "\"Whoa, you actually did it! The papers are gone! You\u2019re like, a paper
    whisperer. Thanks for saving me from, you know, words and numbers attacking me.
    signs the petition There you go, buddy. Now, if you find my Thai food, let me
    know, okay?\""
