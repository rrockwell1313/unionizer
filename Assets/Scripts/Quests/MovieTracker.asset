  - on the phone, visibly distressed as a customer is screaming at him "Sir, I understand
    your frustration, but... gets interrupted, tear in his eye 'Frankly, my dear,
    I don't give a damn.' hangs up, sniffs Oh, hi there. That was a line from 'Gone
    with the Wind'. Helps me cope with, well, gestures to phone. I'm Malachi. I do
    customer service here. Sometimes I wish I was in a Bollywood film, dancing and
    singing my heart out instead of dealing with this. How can I assist you today?"
  - "\"A union? Maybe that could change things. Like a twist in the plot. I\u2019m
    just so tired. My dreams feel as distant as the stars. But if I could have a

    back.\""
  - "\"Amelie, our HR manager, she has a collection of movies for the boss. I can\u2019t
    afford those on my salary, but I love movies. Can you ask her to recommend one
    for me to watch? Something to sweep me away to a different world. If you can
    get me a movie from her, you'll have my signature.\""
  irritatedDialogue:
  - "looks dejected \"Still no movie? It\u2019s like waiting for the happy ending
    that never comes. Please, help me escape, if only for a couple of hours. Then,
    I\u2019ll stand by you in this union endeavor.\""
  angryDialogue:
  - "tearful, resigned \"I needed that escape, and you kept it from me. \u2018You
    either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\u2019
    That\u2019s from \u2018The Dark Knight\u2019. Just leave me be in my melancholy
    cave. No autographs, no encores. And certainly no signature for your petition.
    The show is over.\""
  successDialogue:
  - "eyes light up \"You got it! A movie! Oh, this is just the slice of heaven I
    needed. takes a deep breath I can feel the weight lifting already. Thank you.
    signs the petition Through thick and thin, my fellow protagonist, we\u2019ll
    see how our story unfolds.\"\r"
