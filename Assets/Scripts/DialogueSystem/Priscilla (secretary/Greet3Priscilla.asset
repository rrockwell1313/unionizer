  dialogueText: "\"Okay, here\u2019s the deal. There's this memo I have to deliver
    to Giacomo, the Data Analyst. He\u2019s...persistent. A little too much, if you
    catch my drift. I could use a break from his never-ending 'romantic' overtures.
    If you could take this memo to him and save me the trouble, I\u2019ll sign your
    petition. Fair?\" (The memo has been added to your inventory)"
