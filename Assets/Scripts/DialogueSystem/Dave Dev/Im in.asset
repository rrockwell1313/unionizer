  dialogueText: "Dave: Really? That\u2019s awesome! Here, I drew a map of the office
    areas. It's... not the best, but it should help you find everyone. And you might
    want to hurry. Since you\u2019re the new dev, they'll be looking at you like
    the problem guy if you're not careful. Good luck! And, uh, maybe try not to visit
    the same place twice without results - or they could be really upset. Pick your
    path wisely\u2026and grab some snacks for the journey."
